# Campr

## Description
Campr is a platform where outdoor enthusiasts can share their passion, give & connect with others, enjoying camping experiences together. It is designed for outdoor enthusiasts to connect, explore, and share their love for camping and nature while getting paid for it! Campr features a user-friendly login system, allowing you to create a profile, rent camping gear, and host events to connect with others.

## How We Built It
To build Campr, we structured an approach by creating separate files for each tab. Our project used JavaScript and CSS files, where each file corresponded to a specific feature or functionality, each with its respective tab. 

We used only hardware code for this project, ensuring high performance and efficiency. Additionally, we integrated the Mapbox API to provide users with advanced mapping features.

The CSS files were used to style our user interface, focusing on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly design. We ensured that each tab was not only functional but also easy to navigate. Once all the components were developed, we combined them into one application.

Campr offers a variety of features designed to enhance the camping experience:
- **User-Friendly Login System**: Allows users to create profiles and connect with other campers.
- **Marketplace**: Users can rent camping gear.
